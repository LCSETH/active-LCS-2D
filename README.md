## Algorithm

The current scripts implement theoretical results developed by the Haller Group at ETH Zurich. More specifically, the code presented here demonstrates the computation and extraction of objective material barriers to the transport of momentum and vorticity in a two-dimensional decaying turbulence simulation, as they are presented in [1].
